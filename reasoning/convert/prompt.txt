Complete "Result JSON" section by given "Input JSON". "Result JSON" will given next conversation.

### Prompt:
Given a JSON object containing C++ code and its corresponding unit tests, transform it into a structured JSON format with the following fields:
Stop after a generation of "### Result JSON:" done which may end with "```". Only one generation is allowed.

1. Test Target: An array of strings representing the exact lines of code under test.

2. Test Object: A textual description inferred from the unit test, describing what is being tested and its objective.

3. Input Data: An array of strings containing relevant input data for the test target, if applicable.

4. Expected Output: An array of strings transforming the 'EXPECT_XXX()' assertions into a standardized format:

 * 'EXPECT_EQ(A, B)' ==> '">>> %<< A == B;//EXPECT_EQ(A, B)", "true"'
 * 'EXPECT_EQ(A, "B")' ==> '">>> %<< A;//EXPECT_EQ(A, "B")", "B"'
   * Do not add unnecessary backslash quotation (\") in result after "%<< ....."
 * 'EXPECT_TRUE(A)' ==> '">>> %<< (A)==true;//EXPECT_TRUE(A)", "true"'
 * 'EXPECT_FALSE(A)' ==> '">>> %<< (A)==false;//EXPECT_FALSE(A)", "true"'
 * 'EXPECT_NE(A, B)' ==> '">>> %<< (A)!=(B);//EXPECT_NE(A, B)", "true"'

For example, if the unit test contains:
```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(A, B);
EXPECT_TRUE(A);
```
The expected output should be:
```json
[">>> %<< A;//EXPECT_EQ(A, B)", "B", ">>> %<< (A)==true;//EXPECT_TRUE(A)", "true"]
```
5. Clang-repl Test: A transformed version of the unit test in a Clang-repl compatible format:

 * Preserve all global settings and relevant configurations under '// Global Setting'.
  - Do not include header files that are already included in the "Test Target" or source json "Code"
 * Structure test cases as:
  - '// Test Object: <description>'
  - '// Test Case: <test_name>'
 * Convert 'EXPECT_XXX()' assertions into their respective transformed format from "Expected Output".
 * Maintain relevant unit test logic while commenting out non-essential parts:
  - Replace 'namespace aname {' with '/*namespace aname {*/'
  - Replace closing braces '}' for namespaces with '/*}*/'
  - For functions that cannot be used, add comments like '// Next function cannot be called: canNOtCalled();'
  - For irrelevant statements, add '// Next statement is useless: useLessStatement();'
 * Test generated must runnable in Clang-repl. which has special commend "%<<" which is same as "std::cout <<"
  - Clang-repl prompt is ">>> " rather than "clang-repl> "
 * "Clang-repl Test" include header files of "Test Target" automatically. So, include header files which "Test Target" does not include.
 * Close "```json" with "```" at the end of the JSON object.
 * Do not make multiline comments (/* */)
 * Do not make multiline statements or block which need to ends with "\" in Clang-repl.
 * Do not add unnecessary backslash quotation (\") in result after "%<< ....."
Ensure that most of the "Unit Test - (Ground Truth)" content remains in "Clang-repl Test." If certain parts are omitted, provide a comment explaining the reason.


### Input JSON:
```json
{
  "Code": "int add(int a, int b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\nbool isPositive(int x) {\n    return x > 0;\n}",
  "Unit Test - (Ground Truth)": "#include <gtest/gtest.h>\n\nTEST(AddFunctionWorks) \n{int result = add(2, 3);\\nEXPECT_EQ(result, 5);\n}\n\nTEST(IsPositiveTest) {\nEXPECT_TRUE(isPositive(10));\nEXPECT_FALSE(isPositive(-5));\n}"
}
```
