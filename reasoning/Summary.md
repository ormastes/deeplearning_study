# Integrating Reasoning Verification into LLM Training Pipeline

Integrating a **reasoning verification step** into the LLM training code involves parsing a specially formatted dataset, executing tests via a Clang REPL interface, and using the results to influence the model’s loss and training dynamics. This ensures the model learns not just to produce plausible outputs, but also to produce outputs that **pass automated checks**, thus improving reasoning accuracy. Below, we outline the modifications required in each part of the training pipeline to support this functionality.

## 1. XML Dataset Parsing and Preparation

The training dataset comes in an XML-like format, so the first step is to parse these files and extract the necessary fields for each training example. We need to retrieve the content of the tags: `<Test Target>`, `<Test Object>`, `<Input Data>`, `<Expected Output>`, and `<Clang-repl Test>`. Python’s built-in XML libraries (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree`) can be used to parse the XML structure easily ([Python XML Tutorial: Element Tree Parse & Read  | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-xml-elementtree#:~:text=tree%20%3D%20ET,getroot)). The dataset parsing process will look like this:

1. **Load and Parse XML**: Use ElementTree or a similar library to load each XML file and get the root element. For example: `tree = ET.parse('dataset.xml'); root = tree.getroot()` ([Python XML Tutorial: Element Tree Parse & Read  | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-xml-elementtree#:~:text=tree%20%3D%20ET,getroot)).
2. **Extract Fields**: For each test case node in the XML, extract the text content of the relevant child tags:
   - **Test Target** – a description or prompt of what needs to be tested or achieved.
   - **Test Object** – the specific object or function that is the focus of the test.
   - **Input Data** – the input values or conditions to apply to the test object.
   - **Expected Output** – the correct output or result expected from the test object given the input.
   - **Clang-repl Test** – a snippet of code or command that uses the above information to verify correctness (e.g., a call to the function with the input and an assertion of the expected output).
3. **Prepare Model I/O**: Construct the training input and output from these fields. Typically, the **Test Target** will serve as the prompt or context given to the model, and the model’s task is to generate the **Test Object**, **Input Data**, and **Expected Output** fields. This can be formatted as a combined target sequence (for example, the model could output a structured answer containing the object, input, and expected output). In other words, during training the model sees the Test Target and is trained to predict the other three fields in the correct format. By structuring the output to include all necessary components, we ensure the model learns to produce complete test case answers from the given target description.

**Implementational detail**: you might create a custom PyTorch `Dataset` class that reads the XML files, and for each entry, returns a tuple like `(input_text, target_text)` where `input_text` is the contents of `<Test Target>` and `target_text` is a concatenation (or other structured combination) of the `<Test Object>`, `<Input Data>`, and `<Expected Output>`. Tokenize these appropriately for the model. This way, the standard language modeling loss can be applied to have the model generate the expected fields from the prompt.

## 2. Integrating ClangRepl for Reasoning Evaluation

Once the model generates an output, we need to verify its reasoning or correctness by using the `<Clang-repl Test>` field. The **ClangReplInterface** provides a method `ClangReplInterface.run(commandLine)` that can execute the test code and return a result indicating success or failure. We will incorporate this execution **during training** to provide feedback on the model’s output:

- **Extract the Test Command**: From the parsed data, retrieve the content of the `<Clang-repl Test>` tag. This will typically be a command or code snippet (possibly a call to the Test Object with Input Data and a check against Expected Output) that, when run, verifies the correctness of the output. 
- **Run the Clang REPL Test**: After the model produces its output for a training example (or uses the ground-truth output during training), call `ClangReplInterface.run(...)` with the appropriate command. For example: `result = ClangReplInterface.run(test_command)`. This will execute the test in a Clang (C/C++) REPL environment and return a status – for instance `"PASS"` if the output was correct, `"FAIL"` if the output was incorrect, or `"ERROR"` if there was a compilation/runtime error (perhaps due to an invalid output format).
- **Compute Result-Based Penalty**: Convert the REPL result into a numeric penalty that will be added to the training loss for that example. We define a scheme where an **ERROR** incurs the highest penalty, a **FAIL** a moderate penalty, and a **PASS** no penalty:
  - If `result == "ERROR"`: The model’s output caused a test error (e.g., perhaps it produced syntactically invalid or incomplete content that the test could not even run). This should be heavily penalized. For instance, you might add a large constant to the loss or multiply the base loss by a factor >1 in this case.
  - If `result == "FAIL"`: The output ran but did not produce the expected result. This indicates a reasoning mistake. Assign a smaller penalty for a failure (since at least the format was correct enough to run). For example, add a smaller constant to the loss or a smaller multiplier.
  - If `result == "PASS"`: The model’s output passed the test; it is completely correct in this reasoning check. Ideally, **no additional loss** is added here – the model should not be penalized for a correct result. In fact, you are effectively rewarding the model by leaving the loss as just the baseline prediction loss.
- **Additional Token and Length Penalties**: Beyond the pass/fail status, impose extra loss components for other quality issues in the model’s output:
  - If certain **required tokens or phrases** are missing from the output, apply a penalty. For example, if the output is expected to include a specific keyword (perhaps a function name or a specific format like “Expected Output:”), and the model’s output lacks it, you can add a token-existence penalty. This ensures the model learns to include all necessary parts of the answer.
  - If the output is **too short (below a minimum length)**, apply a penalty. This prevents the model from giving overly terse answers that might skip reasoning steps. It encourages the model to produce a sufficiently detailed response. For instance, if the expected answer should be at least 50 characters but the model produced much less, you add a penalty proportional to the shortfall or a fixed penalty for not meeting the length requirement.

By incorporating these penalties, the loss function now directly accounts for reasoning correctness as verified by an external tool. This approach is akin to how some recent techniques combine standard supervised loss with an external **execution-based reward signal** – e.g., Le et al. (2022) fine-tuned a code model with both next-token loss and feedback from executing the code ([RLEF: Grounding Code LLMs in Execution Feedback with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.02089v1#:~:text=reward%20models,tune%20a)). In our case, the Clang REPL’s `"PASS"`/`"FAIL"` acts as a feedback signal guiding the model. A passing execution yields no extra loss (rewarding the model), while failures and errors produce additional loss that the optimizer will try to minimize by adjusting the model’s weights. This strategy leverages external feedback to improve the model, echoing findings that such feedback is crucial for self-improvement ([CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sx038qxjek#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Recent%20developments%20in%20large,validate%20and%20progressively%20amend%20their)).

## 3. Training Loop Adjustments for Reasoning Verification

With the dataset parsed and the evaluation mechanism defined, we need to modify the training loop to integrate these components. The goal is to process each training example, calculate the standard language modeling loss, run the reasoning verification, and adjust the loss accordingly before backpropagation. Here’s how to modify the training procedure:

- **Batch Processing**: If using mini-batches, ensure that for each sample in the batch you have the corresponding `<Clang-repl Test>` and can handle running tests for each. You might process one sample at a time for the verification step (since executing code for multiple samples in parallel might not be straightforward). Alternatively, if performance allows, process training examples sequentially when doing the verification portion.
- **Forward Pass and Base Loss**: For each training example, feed the model with the **Test Target** as input and compute the predicted output (the sequence for **Test Object + Input Data + Expected Output**). In teacher-forcing mode, you would compute the **cross-entropy loss** between the model’s predicted token probabilities and the ground-truth output sequence. Let this base loss be `loss_ce` – it represents the standard language modeling loss (ensuring the model’s output matches the expected text).
- **Generate Output for Testing**: If the training setup allows, you can also generate the model’s output text (e.g., by taking argmax or sampling from the model’s distribution) to use in the Clang test. In purely supervised training, you might use the ground truth output for the test (since that is the correct answer). However, a more rigorous approach is to use the model’s own predicted sequence to truly measure if the model *would* pass the test on its own. This can be done by decoding the model’s output tokens to text.
- **Run ClangReplInterface**: Take the `<Clang-repl Test>` command and insert the necessary parts (the Test Object, Input Data, Expected Output – either from the model’s generated output or the ground truth if we assume ground truth passes). Then execute `result = ClangReplInterface.run(test_command)`. This will yield `"PASS"`, `"FAIL"`, or `"ERROR"` as described.
- **Calculate Total Loss**: Incorporate the result into the loss:
  - Start with `total_loss = loss_ce` (the cross-entropy loss for generating the expected text).
  - If the Clang test result is fail or error, add the respective penalties. For example: 
    ```python
    if result == "ERROR":
        total_loss += error_penalty  # large penalty for errors
    elif result == "FAIL":
        total_loss += fail_penalty   # smaller penalty for incorrect result
    # (if PASS, no penalty added)
    ```
  - Next, check for token and length requirements. For instance:
    ```python
    if not output_contains_required_tokens:
        total_loss += token_penalty
    if len(output_text) < min_length:
        total_loss += length_penalty
    ```
    These penalties can be simple constants or learned parameters, but constants are often sufficient. They should be tuned so that they are significant enough to influence training (e.g., comparable to the magnitude of `loss_ce` for a single example).
  - The result is a combined loss that reflects both **language modeling accuracy** and **reasoning/test accuracy**. By minimizing `total_loss`, the training will update weights to not only produce the correct text but also to avoid failing the tests.
- **Backpropagation**: Perform backpropagation on `total_loss` and update model parameters as usual (e.g., `optimizer.step()` in PyTorch). Over time, this will push the model to generate outputs that yield fewer penalties – meaning more outputs that pass the Clang tests without error.
- **Validation Phase Changes**: During validation (or testing), we need to evaluate the model’s performance on both the standard text prediction and the reasoning correctness:
  - For each validation example, feed the **Test Target** to the model and **let the model generate** its output (this time without teacher forcing, since we want to simulate actual usage). This could be done with greedy decoding or beam search to get the predicted Test Object, Input Data, and Expected Output.
  - Execute the `ClangReplInterface.run()` on the corresponding test command using the model’s predicted output. Collect the result.
  - Track metrics: count how many examples passed, failed, or errored. For instance, you might compute the **pass rate** (percentage of validation cases where the model’s output passed the test) as a measure of reasoning accuracy.
  - *Logging restriction*: To keep logs manageable, do not log every single validation case. Instead, store only the most recent validation samples or specifically the ones where the model made mistakes (fails/errors). For example, you can maintain a small list of the last N validation cases or use a random sampling of errors to log.
  - Avoid logging huge text outputs for every case. Focus on **logging errors and failures**: if a test failed or errored, record the Test Target, the model’s output, and the expected output for analysis. Successful cases can be omitted or summarized since they are less interesting for debugging.
  - Ensure that the validation loop does not slow down excessively due to the external calls. If performance is a concern, you might skip running the Clang tests on every epoch or use a subset of validation data each time.

By adjusting the training loop in this way, the model is constantly being trained not just on next-token prediction, but also being implicitly trained to **get the right answer** and solve the test cases. This is similar in spirit to reinforcement learning approaches that use test case outcomes as rewards ([RLEF: Grounding Code LLMs in Execution Feedback with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.02089v1#:~:text=on%20human,accuracy%20with%20low%20sample%20budgets)), but here we integrate it directly into supervised training as a modified loss. The result is a form of *execution-guided training* where the model’s parameters are optimized for both language fluency and correctness of the content.

## 4. Logging and Monitoring with TensorBoard

To ensure we can monitor the model’s progress on reasoning tasks, integrate **TensorBoard** logging for the new metrics and outcomes. TensorBoard is useful for tracking various metrics during training ([How to use TensorBoard with PyTorch | by Kuan Hoong, Ph.D](https://kuanhoong.medium.com/how-to-use-tensorboard-with-pytorch-e2b84aa55e67#:~:text=How%20to%20use%20TensorBoard%20with,graph%2C%20viewing%20histograms%2C%20displaying)), and we can leverage it to see how the reasoning verification affects the model. The following logging enhancements should be added:

- **Reasoning Performance Metrics**: Define metrics such as *execution pass rate*, *failure rate*, or *error rate*. For instance, each epoch (or every N batches) compute the fraction of examples where the model’s output passed the Clang test. Log this to TensorBoard using `SummaryWriter.add_scalar()`, e.g., `writer.add_scalar('Reasoning/PassRate', pass_rate, epoch)`. Similarly, you can log the average additional loss due to reasoning penalties (to see if it decreases over time).
- **Standard Metrics**: Continue logging standard metrics like language modeling loss, perplexity, or token accuracy as usual. This helps ensure that the integration of reasoning signals isn’t harming the basic language learning.
- **Log Examples of Failures**: To facilitate debugging, log representative examples of incorrect model outputs. Focus on *failed or errored cases*. For each such case (perhaps up to a limit per epoch to avoid clutter), log a text summary containing:
  - The **Test Target** (problem description).
  - The **model’s generated output** (Test Object, Input, Expected Output).
  - The **expected correct output** from the dataset.
  - The ClangRepl test result (FAIL or ERROR, along with any error message if available).
  
  You can use `writer.add_text('Errors/example1', text, epoch)` to record this information in TensorBoard. By reviewing these in TensorBoard, one can identify common failure modes (e.g., the model consistently gets a certain type of logic wrong).
- **Limit Logging Frequency**: As specified, avoid logging every sample. It’s sufficient to log a handful of recent failures per epoch. You might implement this by collecting failures in a list and, say, logging the last 5 at the end of each epoch, then clearing the list. This satisfies the requirement to “log only recent validation samples, errors, and failures” – keeping the log output focused and relevant.
- **Trace ClangRepl Errors**: If the Clang REPL interface returns an error, it might be useful to log the error message or code that failed. This can help determine whether the issue was with model output formatting or something else. Capturing this in logs (with some sanitization if needed) will guide future fixes or model adjustments.

All these logs can be viewed in TensorBoard’s UI, giving insights into both the model’s language performance and its reasoning verification performance side by side. Over training iterations, you should expect to see the reasoning metrics improve (more passes, fewer fails/errors) as the model learns to avoid mistakes that incur loss penalties. Logging these metrics and examples provides a feedback loop for the researchers to confirm that the integration is working as intended.

## Conclusion

By parsing the XML dataset and structuring the model’s outputs, we enable the LLM to produce detailed test case answers. Incorporating the **ClangReplInterface** in the training loop provides a form of external verification: each output is checked, and the training loss is adjusted based on factual correctness (PASS/FAIL) and other quality heuristics. This aligns the training process with both **language modeling objectives and reasoning correctness objectives**. Such an approach has parallels in recent research where language models are augmented with tool-use or execution feedback to improve their accuracy ([CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sx038qxjek#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Recent%20developments%20in%20large,validate%20and%20progressively%20amend%20their)) ([RLEF: Grounding Code LLMs in Execution Feedback with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.02089v1#:~:text=on%20human,accuracy%20with%20low%20sample%20budgets)). The training code modifications ensure that the model is penalized for flawed reasoning (especially if it produces errors or wrong results) and is encouraged to produce outputs that **pass all tests**. During validation and testing, running the same verification gives a reliable measure of the model’s reasoning ability. All the while, TensorBoard logging of these metrics and errors helps track progress and identify issues. These changes create a seamless integration of reasoning verification into the LLM’s training pipeline, ultimately aiming to optimize both the model’s **standard language proficiency and its validated reasoning accuracy**.
